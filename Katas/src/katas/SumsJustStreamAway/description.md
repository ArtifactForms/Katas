Sums just Stream away...
  
As the title implies, this Kata is about Streams.
Although the concept / language feature is several years old now, a lot of programmers
(including myself) are not really familiar with it. So I decided to build
some Katas around this topic to help us expanding our knowledge. It's rather about 
fundamentals than fancy problems or algorithms.
  
Your job is it to implement various sum up functions.

```sumOfAllNumbers(array)``` returns the sum of all given array elements 

For example:

```
{1, 2, 3, 4} -> 10
```
 
```sumOfAllEvenNumbers(array)``` returns the sum of all even numbers in the given array

For example:

```
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5} -> 6
```
  
```sumOfAllOddNumbers(array)``` returns the sum of all odd numbers in the given array

For example:

```
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5} -> 9
```
  
```sumOfAllNumbersGreaterThan(array, value)``` returns the sum of all numbers greater than the given value

For example:

```
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, 3 -> 9
```
  
```sumOfAllEvenNegativeNumbers(array)``` return the sum of all negative even numbers

For example:

```
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5} -> 0
```

```
{-2, -2, 3, -3} -> -4
```
  
```sumOfAllOddNegativeNumbers(array)``` return the sum of all odd negative numbers

For example:

```
{-2, -100, -3, -1, 100, 2, -3} -> -7
```
  
The goal of this Kata is to force you to get your hands dirty on Streams.
So, here are some important rules for your solution:

1. USE STREAMS!
2. DON'T USE FOR LOOPS!
3. DON'T USE IF-STATEMENTS! 
4. DON'T USE SWITCH STATEMENTS!
5. DON'T EXPECT any passed NULL values
5. HAVE FUN!
  
Let's build up some basic knowledge about this particular powerful language feature.
Have fun and stream away...
